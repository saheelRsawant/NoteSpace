This project was developed by Saheel Sawant, Kartik Rode, Aditi Page and Swarada Sathe for the course of Human Computer Interaction (Spring 2020) taught by Dr. Sharon Chu at the University of Florida. This project is based on the idea of note making from text based PDF files using the concept of Direct Manipulation.
